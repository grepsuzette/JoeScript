This is a left-recursive packrat parser with familiar Regex syntax, inspired by CoffeeScript and PegJs, for the purpose of parsing CoffeeScript and other languages.

The parser works, just run `coffee joescript_grammar_test` to see it parse all the code in this project. If you have trouble running the code, you may need my fork of CoffeeScript (https://github.com/jaekwon/coffee-script).

# Roadmap

* The immediate roadmap is to modify joeson.coffee to generate optimized parser code, for performance reasons.
