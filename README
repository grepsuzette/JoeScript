This is a left-recursive packrat parser with familiar Regex syntax, inspired by CoffeeScript and PegJs, for the purpose of parsing CoffeeScript and other languages.

The parser works, just run `coffee joescript_grammar_test` to see it parse all the code in this project. If you have trouble running the code, you may need my fork of CoffeeScript (https://github.com/jaekwon/coffee-script).

## Parser details

* The parser is essentially a left-recursive packrat parser, as far as I can tell. It's like a memoized top-down recursive descent parser but with the added ability to parse non-ambiguous left-recursive grammars.
* It is not a general CFG parser. Some limitations below:

```
  START:   "EXPR"
  EXPR:
    EXPR1: "EXPR '-' EXPR"
    EXPR2: "NUM"
  NUM:     "/[0-9]+/"

  parses '3-2-1' right-recursively, which is unexpected.
```

```
  START:   "EXPR"
  EXPR:    "'x' EXPR 'x' | 'x'"

  fails to parse 'xxxxx': counting problem.
```
  
```
  START: "A | B"
  A:     "A 'a' | B | 'a'"
  B:     "B 'b' | A | 'b'"

  fails to parse 'ababa' due to greediness.
```

## Roadmap

* The immediate roadmap is to modify joeson.coffee to generate optimized parser code, for performance reasons.
