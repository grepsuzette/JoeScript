var code
after Midnight, it
  it surrounds me
  like a container,
    contains water

This is a parser, inspired by CoffeeScript and PegJs.

# immediate roadmap

1. Make the syntax in joescript.joe parseable by joescript grammar. (DONE)
2. Finish translator to translate callback code in joescript.joe into javascript.
3. Adapt joeson.coffee to work with new grammar structure. (DONE)
4. Add AST generation to joeson.coffee to make it a parser generator.

# TODO

* Integrate regex directly into the grammar
* Fix regex to allow \n and multiline matching
