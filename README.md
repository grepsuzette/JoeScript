This fork has no other purpose than to facilitate diffing (with https://github.com/grepsuzette/joeson). 

# This is no reference code

Whenever code comments in https://github.com/grepsuzette/joeson ever make reference to "original implementation" such as `joeson.coffee:832`, the line numbers are always those of https://github.com/jaekwon/JoeScript.

# Changes

Only 2 files have been changed: `joeson.coffee` and `joeson_test.coffee`.

There are more tests and it can read 2 **environment variables**:

* `TEST`: what test to run
* `TRACE`: what traces to enable

Please refer to https://github.com/grepsuzette/joeson/blob/master/docs/testing.md for more information.
